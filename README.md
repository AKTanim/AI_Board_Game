## Implementation of MiniMax algorithm based AI game, "Impasse" in PyGame.

## The Game: Impasse
I have implemented the board game "Impasse" using PyGame. "Impasse" is quite similar to "Checkers", although it has some interesting twist in rules. This makes the implementation a bit more complex than "Checkers". The game rules can be found here:

## The AI
I have used the MiniMax algorithm here. Alpha-Beta pruning has also been implemented to improve the performance of the search algorithm. It is also possible to play the game against a human opponent.
